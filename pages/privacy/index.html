                        <p>Like most website operators, Scroll If collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, operating device, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.  Our purpose in collecting non-personally-identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our website.  From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our website.</p>
                        <p>Scroll If also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our websites in any area that allows such comments.  We only disclose logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

                        <p>Certain visitors to our websites choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information.
